## Basic Project Structure

Acetate sites have 3 common components need to get started:

1. A folder containing HTML and Markdown pages. This is generally called `src`.
2. A `acetate.config.js` file that defines basic project configuration.

## Quick Start

```bash
$ npm install -g acetate-cli
```

Clone the Acetate sample project and `cd` into it:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/patrickarlt/acetate-sample.git && cd ./acetate-sample
```

Install the dependencies with NPM:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Run the built-in development server:

```bash
$ acetate server
```
